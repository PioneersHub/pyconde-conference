# üåü Guidelines for Active Contribution and Volunteer Inactivity

As a volunteer with {{config.extra.event.event_name}}, your contributions are vital to the success of our conference. We deeply appreciate
the time and skills you dedicate to this endeavor.

## üèÜ Expectations for Active Contribution

When you join a committee, you commit to a certain level of engagement, as detailed in the committee description. Active contribution
includes:

1. **Timely task completion**: Completing assigned tasks within the agreed-upon timeframes.
2. **Active meeting participation**: Engaging in meetings, contributing to discussions, and collaborating on solutions. We encourage having
   your camera on when possible to foster a sense of presence and teamwork.
3. **Responsiveness and Communication**: Be responsive in our communication channels, including chat platforms and email, even between
   meetings. Timely responses are crucial for effective collaboration and decision-making.

We understand that the level of commitment can vary based on the committee and the phase of the conference planning. It's important to note
that being active doesn't necessarily mean you're always working on something. There will be natural ebbs and flows in activity levels
depending on the committee's workload and the stage of the planning process.

Once you've made a substantial contribution to a particular task or project and it's completed, it's perfectly normal to have a period of
reduced activity until the next task arises. This doesn't mean you're inactive - it simply reflects the natural rhythm of the work.

## üö© Signals of Inactivity

While we understand that activity levels may fluctuate, there are certain signals that may indicate a volunteer has become inactive:

1. **Consistently missing deadlines**: If a volunteer regularly fails to complete tasks within the agreed-upon timeframes without
   communicating challenges or seeking an extension.
2. **Prolonged unresponsiveness**: If a volunteer is consistently unreachable or unresponsive in communication channels, despite multiple
   attempts to contact them.
3. **Repeated absence from meetings**: If a volunteer frequently misses meetings without prior notice or follow-up.

If we observe these signals, we'll reach out to check in and see if there's anything we can do to support the volunteer's active
contribution.

## üï∞Ô∏è Changes in Availability

We recognize that life circumstances can change and that the time you have available to dedicate to the conference may fluctuate. If you
find that you are no longer able to meet the commitment expectations for your role, or if your availability has significantly decreased,
please let us know as soon as possible.

There is no need to provide a detailed explanation - a simple notice to your committee chair or the volunteer coordinator is appreciated. We
understand that sometimes things can go really bad, and in these situations, it's especially important to communicate so that your team is
not left hanging.

We respect your privacy and autonomy, and we're here to support you. If you need to step back, please don't hesitate to let us know. The
sooner we're aware, the better we can adapt and redistribute tasks to ensure the continued smooth operation of the team.

## üåø Inactivity and Team Dynamics

In the event that a volunteer becomes inactive or unresponsive without notice, it can impact the rest of the team. Delays in tasks or
decisions can hinder progress and create uncertainty for those volunteers who remain active.

To maintain a positive and productive team dynamic, if a volunteer appears to have become inactive, we may need to proceed with reassigning
their responsibilities and removing them from the committee.

Please understand that this is not a personal judgment. We have a responsibility to all of our volunteers and to the success of the
conference to ensure that our teams remain active and engaged.

## üåª Open Communication and Gratitude

We strive to foster a culture of open, honest communication in our volunteer teams. If you're experiencing challenges in meeting the
expectations of your role, please don't hesitate to reach out to your committee chair, The Office or the Steering Committee. We're here to
support you and to find solutions together.

And if the time does come for you to step away from your volunteer role, please know that we are immensely grateful for all that you have
contributed. Your efforts, no matter the duration, have played a part in making {{config.extra.event.event_name}} a success.

## üåà Rejoining the Team

If your circumstances change and you find yourself able to meet the contribution expectations again in the future, we welcome you to reach
out. Once a part of the {{config.extra.event.event_name}} volunteer community, always a part of the community.

Thank you for your understanding, your commitment, and your part in making {{config.extra.event.event_name}} an incredible event. Your
active contributions are what bring our conference to life.

If you have any questions about these guidelines, please don't hesitate to ask. We're always here to clarify and to support you in your
volunteering journey.
