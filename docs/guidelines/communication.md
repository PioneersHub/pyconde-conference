## Newsletters

We can send newsletters to everyone who has signed up in the past (10,000+ people).  

### Considerations  

- Our goal is to provide useful, concise information, including:  
  - **Announcements**: ticket sales, CfP (Call for Proposals), grant programs, conference dates, and satellite events (e.g., DjangoGirls).  
  - **Reminders**: CfP deadlines, ticket sales, and late-bird registration.  

- We want to ensure the newsletter is relevant to recipients, including:  
  - Participants  
  - Volunteers  
  - Companies / Sponsors  

- We aim to avoid spam and keep emails infrequent (about one per month).  

## Updates for Participants  

To avoid overwhelming attendees with unnecessary details, logistical information (e.g., visiting the venue, getting around) will be sent only to **registered participants** via the ticketing system.  

## Email Process  

1. Draft the email in Google Docs.  
2. Coordinate with relevant committees on content. Keep deadines in mind, do not wait for others if they do not come around timely.     
4. Keep emails **concise and engaging**, with links for more details.  
5. Ensure detailed information is published on our website (e.g., as a blog post).
6. Once reviewed and ready, ping a newsletter admin to arrange for the newsletter to be sent.
