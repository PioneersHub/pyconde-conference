# Community Support Committee

## Mission

The Community Support Committee ensures that every participant feels welcomed, supported, and included throughout the conference
experience.  
Its mission is to foster a positive, respectful, and enjoyable environment for attendees, speakers, and volunteers — from first contact to
follow-up after the event.  
This committee serves as the friendly and reliable point of contact for the community, helping to address concerns, guide attendees, and
ensure that everyone can fully participate.

## Committee Structure

### Chair

The Chair(s) of the Community Support Committee lead and coordinate the team’s efforts to ensure smooth and empathetic attendee
interaction.  
They organize the volunteer shifts, maintain clear communication with other committees, and oversee community well-being before, during, and
after the event.  
The Chair(s) will attend virtual planning meetings and be on-site at the conference to manage support operations.
