# Volunteer Committees

The committees are the driving force behind the conference, responsible for shaping its many facets. We’re seeking
passionate individuals who want to contribute to its success.

We value diversity and strongly encourage people from underrepresented groups to apply. Whether you’re an expert in your
field or eager to learn and grow with us, there’s a place for you on our team.

## Committee Descriptions

Please review the committee descriptions to find the one that best fits your interests and skills.

The conference is realized by [volunteer organizers](index.md) and the [conference office](../office/index.md).

While the volunteers are responsible for the conference content, authenticity and attendees' experience,
the backoffice is responsible for the organization (sponsoring, finances, budget, contracts, etc.).

## Committee Team Health

A healthy, motivated team is the foundation of our success. We value openness, fairness, and reliability in how we work together.  
Joining a committee means being part of a hands-on team where everyone contributes and supports one another.

- **Active Contribution:**  
  Joining a committee means taking responsibility for a clear and manageable task — and following through. Just joining meetings is not enough.

- **Shared Responsibility:**  
  We aim for a fair distribution of work so that everyone contributes meaningfully and no one carries the load alone.

- **Respectful Accountability:**  
  If someone consistently cannot contribute, we’ll kindly ask them to step back — no hard feelings, but we want to keep our teams focused and balanced.

- **Supportive Culture:**  
  We encourage open communication, offer help when someone feels stuck, and celebrate each other’s progress.

- **Positive Collaboration:**  
  We believe in constructive feedback, shared learning, and creating an environment where everyone feels valued and inspired to do their best work.
